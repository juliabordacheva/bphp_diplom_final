— Peter Petrovich! "protect me!" she cried. Impress upon this foolish creature that she dares not treat a noble lady in misfortune in this way, that there is a court for it... I'm going to the Governor-General himself... She will answer... Remembering my father's bread and salt, protect the orphans.
"Allow me, Madame.".. Allow me, allow me, Madam — "said Pyotr Petrovitch," I had no honour to know your father, as you know... allow me, Madam! (someone laughed aloud), and your incessant squabbles with Amalia Ivanovna, I do not intend to participate-S... I'm on my own... and I wish to explain myself immediately to your stepdaughter, Sophia... Ivanovna... Isn't that right?" Let me pass...
And Pyotr Petrovitch, sidling round Katerina Ivanovna, went to the opposite corner, where Sonia was.
Katerina Ivanovna just stood there, and remained as if thunderstruck. She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could have renounced the bread and salt of her father. Having once invented this bread and salt, she already believed it herself. Hit it and the business, Packed full of even some threats contemptuous tone of Pyotr Petrovitch. And everyone seemed to quiet down little by little when he appeared. Besides the fact that this "business and serious" man was too sharply out of harmony with the whole company, besides, it was evident that he had come for something important, that perhaps some extraordinary reason could attract him to such a company, and that, therefore, something was about to happen, something would happen. Raskolnikov, who was standing beside Sonia, stood aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not seem to notice him at all. In a minute Lebezyatnikov appeared on the threshold; he did not enter the room, but stopped also with a peculiar curiosity, almost with surprise; listened, but seemed to long for something he could not understand.
